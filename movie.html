<h1> The Departed</h1> </br>
<img src="images/departed.jpg" alt="departed">
</br><p>Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts State Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: </br> Billy Costigan is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello to get evidence </br> to arrest him. His true identity is known only by his superiors Dignam and Oliver Queenan. The protege of Costello, </br> Colin Sullivan, is promoted in the Massachusetts State Police and is the informer of Costello.</br> Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other "rat."
